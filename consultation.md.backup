## The Problem

Most companies discover security gaps after deploying AI features to production. Questions that should have been answered during architecture:

- How do we prevent prompt injection attacks?
- Can tenants see each other's data in the vector database?
- How do we rate-limit LLM calls and prevent cost overruns?
- Can we pass SOC2 audit with this architecture?

The typical answer: "We didn't design for that." The refactor takes 6 months and costs hundreds of thousands in engineering time.

**You don't have to learn this the expensive way.**

## What You Get in 30 Minutes

**🔒 Security Gap Analysis**
I'll review you

**Security Gap Analysis**  
Review of your AI infrastructure identifying the top 3-5 security risks that could derail deployment or cause a breach.

**Implementation Roadmap**  
Prioritized action plan specific to your architecture—what to fix now, what to design for, and what can wait.

**Production-Proven Patterns**  
Real solutions from banking, defense, aerospace, and automotive environments. What actually works in production versus what sounds good in theory.

**Custom Security Checklist**  
Personalized checklist for your use case: LLM APIs, vector databases, Kubernetes deployments, multi-tenant SaaS, or compliance requirement
- **CTOs and Engineering Leaders** deploying AI/LLM features at SaaS companies
- **Security Teams** evaluating AI infrastructure risks before production
- **Platform Engineers** building Kubernetes-based AI/ML platforms
- **Compliance Officers** ensuring AI systems meet SOC2, GDPR, or HIPAA requirements
- **Mid-Market to Enterprise** companies where security incidents destroy customer trust

## What We'll Cover

### Current State Assessment (10 minutes)

- Your AI/ML infrastructure architecture
- Existing security controls and gaps
- Compliance requirements and constraints
- Development and deployment workflows

### Risk Identification (15 minutes)

- Data security and privacy vulnerabilities
- Model security and intellectual property protection
- Infrastructure and access control weaknesses
- Operational security and monitoring gaps

### Action Plan (5 minutes)

- Prioritized security improvements
- Quick wins vs. strategic initiatives
- Resource requirements and timelines
- Next steps and implementation guidance

## Background

**Amine Raji, PhD, CISSP** — 15+ years securing production systems in banking (Société Générale), defense, aerospace (Airbus), and automotive (Volvo Cars).

I design and build secure AI systems from the ground up. My [blog](/) shares production-ready architectures and [open-source projects](https://github.com/aminrj) demonstrate working implementations.

Most security consultants audit what's wrong. I show you how to fix it with working code, deployment patterns, and architectural decisions that scale.

### Recent Results

**Prevented Architecture Refactor**  
Advised SaaS company on multi-tenant LLM isolation design from day one, avoiding 6-month refactor (estimated $500K engineering cost saved)

**Accelerated Compliance**  
Helped healthcare technology startup implement SOC2-compliant AI infrastructure in 30 days instead of 6 months

## Frequently Asked Questions
Is this really free?**  
Yes. I offer these assessments because I've seen too many companies discover critical security gaps after deployment. Prevention is easier than remediation, and 30 minutes now can save months of refactoring later.

**Will you try to sell me something?**  
This is a technical assessment, not a sales call. If your architecture needs work, I'll tell you. If it's solid, I'll tell you that too. We can discuss ongoing work if it makes sense, but there's no pressure.

**What if we're just getting started with AI?**  
Perfect timing. It's much easier to design security correctly from the beginning than to retrofit it later. I'll help you avoid common mistakes companies make when rushing to production.

**What if our system is already in production?**  
I can identify specific risks in your running system and give you a prioritized remediation plan focused on what needs immediate attention.

**Do I need to prepare anything?**  
Just a high-level understanding of your architecture: what AI/LLM services you're using, where they run, and what data they process. I'll ask questions during the call.

**What if we're under NDA?**  
No problem. We can sign an NDA before our call. I work with defense, banking, and automotive clients who require strict confidentiality.

**Do you work with startups?**  
Yes, from startups to Fortune 500. The security principles are the same, though implementation approaches differ based on resources and scal
A: Everything is confidential. I'll sign an NDA if requested, and I never share client information or use it for any other purpose.
