## About me

I’m the Global Head of Research for Consulting at WithSecure. Since joining the
cybersecurity industry following a stint as a software engineer, I’ve has
focused on offensive security testing in cloud-native environments and
organisations. More recently, I’ve been putting that experience to use helping
enterprises validate and enhance their attack detection capabilities,
particularly in the cloud space. This led to the development of Leonidas, a
cloud-native attack simulation and detection framework. Prior to taking over as
Head of Research, I led the cloud security consulting team for five years. I’m
also an AWS Community Builder

I hold a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science from the University of
Southampton, along with the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and
AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional.
