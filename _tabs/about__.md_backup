# Securing AI Infrastructure in Production

**I'm Amine Raji, PhD** – I help enterprises deploy AI systems securely using battle-tested cloud-native infrastructure. With 15+ years in software engineering and a CISSP certification, I bridge the critical gap between AI innovation and cybersecurity reality.

## What I Do

**AI Security Architecture:** I design and implement secure AI deployment pipelines on Kubernetes, ensuring your models are protected from development to production.

**Cloud-Native Security:** From container security to service mesh implementation, I help organizations build defensible AI infrastructure that scales.

**Risk Assessment & Compliance:** I conduct comprehensive AI security audits and help teams meet regulatory requirements while maintaining development velocity.

## Proven Track Record

- **15+ years** in production software engineering across enterprise environments
- **PhD in Computer Science** with deep expertise in distributed systems
