I am a Cloud Security Specialist and CloudSec Lead. I am passionate about
InfoSec, DevSecOps, and Cloud Security Automation. I am a Certified Information
Systems Security Professional (CISSP).  

Since joining the cybersecurity industry following a stint as a software engineer, I’ve has
focused on offensive security testing in cloud-native environments and
organisations.

More recently, I’ve been putting that experience to use helping fortune 500
enterprises validate and enhance their attack detection capabilities,
particularly in the cloud space.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the European University of Brittany
(France), along with the several Information Security certificates.
