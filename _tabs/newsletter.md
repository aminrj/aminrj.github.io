## What You'll Learn

Every week, I share **actionable insights** from securing AI systems in real enterprise environments. This isn't theoretical content—it's battle-tested knowledge from implementing AI security at scale.

**For Engineering Leaders**: Strategic insights on building secure AI teams, compliance frameworks, and risk management approaches that enable innovation.

**For Security Engineers**: Technical deep dives into AI-specific attack vectors, defensive strategies, and security tooling that actually works in production.

**For DevSecOps Teams**: Practical automation scripts, CI/CD security patterns, and infrastructure-as-code templates for securing AI workloads on Kubernetes.

## Recent Edition Example

**Subject**: "Securing LLM APIs: Beyond Rate Limiting"

_This week's deep dive covers advanced protection strategies for production LLM endpoints, including input sanitization, output filtering, and prompt injection defense. Plus: a complete Kubernetes Network Policy template for AI microservices._

- **Technical Focus**: Input validation frameworks for LLM APIs
- **Case Study**: How a fintech startup prevented model extraction attacks
- **Tools Review**: Comparing LLM security scanning tools
- **Code Sample**: Kubernetes admission controller for AI workload validation

## About the Author

I'm Amine Raji, founder of [Molntek](https://molntek.com) and your guide through the complex landscape of AI security. With a PhD in Computer Science and CISSP certification, I've spent 15+ years securing production systems for organizations from startups to Fortune 500 companies.

**Why I Write This Newsletter**: The AI security landscape moves fast, and most content is either too theoretical or too vendor-focused. I share what actually works in production—tested solutions you can implement immediately.
