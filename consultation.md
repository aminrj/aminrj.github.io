## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes, completely free. I offer these assessments to help organizations understand their AI security posture. No strings attached.

**Q: Will you try to sell me something?**
A: This is a genuine assessment, not a sales call. If you need ongoing help after our session, we can discuss options, but there's no pressure.

**Q: What if I'm just getting started with AI?**
A: Perfect! It's much easier to build security in from the beginning than to retrofit it later. I'll help you start with the right foundation.

**Q: Do you work with all company sizes?**
A: Yes, from startups to Fortune 500. The security principles are the same, though implementation approaches differ based on resources and scale.

**Q: What happens to the information I share?**
A: Everything is confidential. I'll sign an NDA if requested, and I never share client information or use it for any other purpose.
