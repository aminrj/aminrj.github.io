When designing a secure API, various aspects must be considered to safeguard
your system against potential threats.

These include identifying the assets that need protection, defining security
goals, implementing security mechanisms, and understanding the environment in
which the API operates.

This article explores these elements by presenting the most common security mechanisms, the importance of input validation, and the necessity of proper authentication and access control.

## Key Security Considerations

### Identifying Assets

APIs are often responsible for managing sensitive assets, such as customer
information, credit card details, and database contents.

Protecting these assets is crucial, and this protection is achieved by setting
clear security goals and employing appropriate mechanisms.

### Defining Security Goals

Defining security goals are vital in defining what it means to protect your
assets.

The "CIA Triad" is a well-known framework used to establish these goals:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that information is accessible only to the intended audience.
- **Integrity:** Prevents unauthorized creation, modification, or destruction of information.
- **Availability:** Ensures that legitimate users can access the API when needed, without being hindered.

### Implementing Security Mechanisms

To achieve the defined security goals, various mechanisms can be applied.

Threats are countered by employing these mechanisms, which are tailored to the
specific environment in which the API operates.

It is significantly more cost-effective to consider security during the development phase rather than addressing defects post-production.

Several security mechanisms are essential for any well-designed API:

- **Encryption:** Protects data from being read by unauthorized parties, both in
  transit and at rest. Modern encryption also ensures that data cannot be tampered
  with by attackers.
- **Authentication:** Verifies that users and clients are who they claim to be.
- **Access Control (Authorization):** Ensures that every request to the API is
  properly authorized.
- **Audit Logging:** Records all operations to provide accountability and enable
  proper monitoring.
- **Rate-Limiting:** Prevents any single user or group from monopolizing
  resources, ensuring fair access for all legitimate users and ensuring
  availability.

## Developing Secure REST APIs

REST APIs are well-suited for a wide range of applications, particularly in web
and cloud-based environments, but also introduce specific security
considerations that need to be addressed during development.

This section explores key strategies to protect your APIs from common
vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks, improper input validation, and
denial of service (DoS) attacks.

### Preventing Injection Attacks

Injection attacks remain a significant threat to software security.

They occur when unvalidated user input is incorporated directly into dynamic
commands or queries, allowing attackers to control the executed code.

To prevent injection attacks:

- **Prepared Statements:** Use APIs that support prepared statements, where user
  inputs are clearly separated from dynamic code. This ensures that the database
  cannot mistake user input for executable code.
- **Permissions:** Limit database permissions to prevent unauthorized actions.
  For example, if your API doesn’t need to delete tables, don’t grant it that
  permission. This reduces the potential impact of an SQL injection attack.

### Input Validation and Safe Output

Security flaws often arise when attackers submit inputs that violate code assumptions. To mitigate this:

- **Input Validation:** Define acceptable inputs using well-established formats and libraries. An allow list, specifying valid inputs, is more secure than a blocklist, which tries to exclude invalid ones.
- **Safe Output:** Ensure that all API outputs are well-formed and cannot be
  exploited. Apply standard HTTP security headers to all responses and
  double-check error responses.

### Rate-Limiting for Availability

Rate-limiting is crucial in defending against denial of service (DoS) attacks.
By applying rate limits to all requests, especially unauthenticated ones, you
prevent your servers from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic.

This should be the first security measure applied when processing a request.

### Authentication to Prevent Spoofing

Authentication is vital for knowing who is performing an operation in your API.

While rate-limiting applies to all requests, authentication ensures that
subsequent security controls, like audit logging and access control, function
correctly.

HTTP Basic authentication, a widely used method, involves sending credentials in
a standard HTTP header.

Web browsers have built-in support for HTTP Basic authentication as does curl
and many other command-line tools.

This allows you to send a username and password to the API, but you need to
securely store and validate that password.

A better way would be to outsource authentication to another organization using
a federation protocol like SAML or OpenID Connect or by using an LDAP
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory.

### Using HTTPS

Encryption via HTTPS is essential for protecting data transmitted between the
client and API.

HTTPS ensures that the server presenting the API is legitimate by verifying its certificate.

Without HTTPS, sensitive data like passwords could be intercepted by malicious
entities.

### Audit Logging for Accountability

To maintain accountability, all actions performed using your API should be
recorded in an audit log.

These logs should be sent to a centralized Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) system for analysis, helping detect potential threats and
unusual behavior.

### Implementing Access Control

Beyond basic authentication, access control determines what actions a user can
perform.

An access control list (ACL) specifies which users can access specific objects
and defines the permissions for each user.

### Avoiding Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation attacks can be mitigated by restricting the ability to
grant permissions.

Ensure that new users are not granted more permissions than the existing user
who is adding them, or restrict permission-granting capabilities to users with
full permissions.

## Securing gRPC APIs

gRPC is an open source Remote Procedure Call(RPC) framework that can be used to
build scalable and robust applications.

gRPC APIs, unlike REST APIs, use a binary protocol (Protocol Buffers) instead of
JSON and are designed for high-performance communication between services, often
in microservices architectures.

To develop secure gRPC APIs, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Use Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: Ensure secure communication by implementing mTLS,
   which not only encrypts data in transit but also authenticates both the client
   and the server.
2. **Use Streaming Carefully**: If using gRPC's streaming capabilities, ensure
   proper handling of stream flow and limits to avoid resource exhaustion and
   ensure secure data handling.
3. **Control Service Exposure**: Only expose necessary gRPC services and
   methods, and ensure that internal services are not accidentally exposed to
   external clients.
4. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and
   monitoring to track access patterns, detect anomalies, and facilitate auditing
   of gRPC calls.

Other controls from the REST APIs mitigations are still valid for gRPC APIs.
This includes enforcing authentication and authorization, validating inputs and
outputs, rate-limiting as well as secure handling of errors.

## Conclusion

API security is a multifaceted challenge that requires careful consideration of
assets, security goals, and appropriate mechanisms.

By focusing on input validation, rate-limiting, authentication, and access
control, developers can create robust APIs that resist common threats and
protect valuable assets.
