# Archived Content

This folder contains articles that don't align with the primary **AI Security Expert** positioning of aminrj.com.

## Why Archive These?

**Brand Strategy:** Expert positioning requires focus. When you're positioned as "knows many things," you become no one's first choice. CTOs hiring for AI security consulting want THE expert, not someone who "also does AI security among other things."

**Different Audiences:**
- Main site (aminrj.com): CTOs, security teams, platform engineers deploying AI/LLM systems
- Archived content: Homelab enthusiasts, personal productivity seekers, general automation learners

**Different Value:**
- Main site: $15K+ consulting engagements, enterprise security assessments
- Archived content: Free tutorials and personal projects

## Future Content Strategy

### ✅ Aligned with Brand (Keep on Main Site)
- **LLM/AI Security**: Prompt injection, model security, secure inference
- **Kubernetes Security**: RBAC, secrets management, network policies for AI workloads
- **Cloud-Native Security**: Security in CI/CD, GitOps security, IaC security
- **Compliance**: SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR for AI systems
- **Cryptography**: When framed as security fundamentals (encryption for model protection, secure key management)

### ⚠️ Conditional (Only if Tied to AI Security)
- **Blockchain**: Only if addressing specific AI security use cases (model provenance, supply chain security)
- **Zero Trust**: If applied to AI/LLM architectures

### ❌ Archive (Dilutes Expert Positioning)
- General automation tutorials
- Personal homelab projects
- Career development content
- Book reviews (unless security-focused)
- Personal productivity tools
