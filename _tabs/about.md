## My Approach

I believe security should **enable innovation, not hinder it**. My methodology focuses on:

**Security-First Architecture** – Building security into AI systems from day one, not as an afterthought.

**Production-Proven Methods** – Every recommendation comes from real implementations in enterprise environments.

**Business-Aligned Solutions** – Security strategies that support business goals and accelerate time-to-market.

## Why Work With Me

As founder of [Molntek](https://molntek.com), I've helped organizations from startups to Fortune 500 companies implement secure AI infrastructure. I combine deep technical expertise with business understanding to deliver solutions that actually work in production.

My unique background spans both academic research and hands-on enterprise implementation, giving me the perspective to solve complex AI security challenges that others miss.
