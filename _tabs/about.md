I’m a Cloud Security Specialist and CloudSec Lead, living at the intersection of
InfoSec, DevSecOps, and automation. My mission? To make the cloud a safer place,
one smart automation at a time.

With a background in software engineering, I leapt into cybersecurity and found
my passion in offensive security testing, specifically for cloud-native
environments and innovative organizations. Today, I’m leveraging that experience
to help Fortune 500 companies level up their attack detection and defenses in
the cloud.

I’ve got the creds to back it up too— a PhD in Computer Science from the
European University of Brittany (France), and a few other InfoSec certifications
(CISSP, CEH, GIAC , Azure Administrator, Microsoft AI engineer, Certified
Kubernetes Administrator, ...) that say, "Yes, I really do love security.
